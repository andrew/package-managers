# Package management document library

Originally forked from https://github.com/ipfs-inactive/package-managers

The following items are materials created or collected by the IPFS Package Managers Task Force in order to facilitate research and development and, as such, act as a living inventory and analysis of the present package manager landscape. If you're interested in learning more about package management in general, or integrating IPFS into current-state package managers in particular, you'll find a lot to chew on here.

Is there something missing from this document library? Would you like to contribute your research or analysis? PRs are welcome!
